## 🚨 Critical Findings Requiring Immediate Action

### Priority 1: Large JavaScript Chunk

- **File**: `chunk-BYlyF5jk.js`
- **Size**: 606.65 KB (exceeds 500KB threshold)
- **Impact**: Major bundle size contributor
- **Action**: Investigate and split into smaller chunks

### Priority 2: CSS Bundle Growth

- **Issue**: 40KB increase (415KB → 455.3KB)
- **Impact**: Moving away from 250KB target
- **Action**: Implement aggressive Tailwind purging

### Priority 3: Vendor Chunking

- **Issue**: 0 vendor chunks detected
- **Impact**: Missed optimization opportunity
- **Action**: Configure Vite for proper vendor separation
