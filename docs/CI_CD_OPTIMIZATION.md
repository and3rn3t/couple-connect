# CI/CD Cache Optimization Strategy

## 📦 Dependency Caching
- Use `npm ci` for faster, deterministic installs
- Cache `node_modules` based on `package-lock.json` hash
- Set `NPM_CONFIG_PROGRESS=false` to reduce output noise

## 🏗️ Build Caching
- Cache Vite build artifacts in `.vite` directory
- Use incremental builds when possible
- Cache TypeScript compilation output

## 🔄 Artifact Management
- Upload build artifacts with compression
- Set appropriate retention periods (7 days for builds, 30 days for reports)
- Use matrix builds for parallel execution

## 📊 Performance Monitoring
- Track bundle sizes over time
- Monitor build duration trends
- Set bundle size limits and fail builds if exceeded

## 🚀 Deployment Optimization
- Use artifact download instead of rebuilding
- Implement deployment previews for PRs
- Optimize Cloudflare Pages deployment
