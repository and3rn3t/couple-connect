# Docker Workflow Build Failure - Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary

The Docker build step in the GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:

```text
ERROR: failed to build: tag is needed when pushing to registry
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by GitHub Actions skipping the `image-tags` output from the setup job because it contained what GitHub considered to be secrets. This happened because:

1. The Docker metadata action was using `${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME || 'and3rn3t' }}` in the image name
2. GitHub Actions automatically detects and masks outputs that contain secret references
3. When the tags output was masked/skipped, the Docker build-push action received no tags
4. Without tags, Docker cannot push to a registry, hence the error

## Evidence

From the workflow logs:

```text
! Skip output 'image-tags' since it may contain secret.
üîç Setup Build Context: .github#3

! Skip output 'image-tags' since it may contain secret.
üîç Setup Build Context: .github#3
```

And the actual Docker command that was executed:

```bash
/usr/bin/docker buildx build --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1
  --cache-from type=gha --cache-to type=gha,mode=max --file ./Dockerfile
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push .
  # Notice: NO --tag parameter!
```

## Solution

Changed all references from `${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME || 'and3rn3t' }}` to the hardcoded value `and3rn3t` in the following files:

### Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/docker.yml`**
   - Metadata action image name
   - Docker login username
   - Security scan image references
   - Summary output references

2. **`.github/workflows/docker-test.yml`**
   - Docker login username
   - Build and push commands

3. **`.github/workflows/deploy-environments.yml`**
   - Docker login username
   - Image tag variables in deployment scripts

### Changes Made

- Removed secret references from image naming to prevent output masking
- Hardcoded the Docker username (`and3rn3t`) since it's not sensitive information
- Maintained the `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secret for authentication

## Testing

- Local Docker build confirmed working: ‚úÖ
- Pushed changes to trigger new workflow run
- The Docker username is publicly visible in Docker Hub anyway, so hardcoding it poses no security risk

## Prevention

- Avoid using secrets in outputs that are passed between jobs
- Use hardcoded values for non-sensitive information like usernames
- Consider using environment variables at the job level instead of in outputs

## Status

üîß **FIXED** - Docker workflows should now build successfully with proper image tags.
