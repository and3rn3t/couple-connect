## 📊 Current Project Health

### Performance Status

| Metric | Current | Target | Progress |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Total Bundle | 1.6 MB | 1.5 MB | 🟡 107% |
| JavaScript | 1.18 MB | 800 KB | 🔴 148% |
| CSS | 415 KB | 250 KB | 🔴 166% |
| Mobile Components | 23% | 80% | 🔴 29% |

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **606 KB JavaScript chunk** (`chunk-zxUleISs.js`) - **Priority P0**
2. **Mobile component coverage** (23% vs 80% target) - **Priority P1**
3. **CSS bundle optimization** (415 KB vs 250 KB target) - **Priority P1**

## 🎯 Next Development Focus

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)

1. **Investigate large JavaScript chunk** - Use `npm run build:analyze`
2. **Convert high-priority components** to mobile-optimized versions
3. **Implement aggressive CSS purging** and critical CSS extraction

### Commands for Next Steps

```bash
# Analyze bundle composition
npm run build:analyze

# Mobile performance monitoring
npm run perf:mobile

# Large chunk investigation
node scripts/investigate-large-chunks.js

# Mobile testing
npm run test:mobile
```
